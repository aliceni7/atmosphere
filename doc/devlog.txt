Home page displays more statistics

New variable: State GDP from the BEAAPI. Weird x4 thing because there is an
entry in the dataset for every quarter, rather than every year, but it seems to
work. Flags API was messed up, fixed that as well.

Successfully implemented the U.S. Energy Information Administration API, as well
as a nifty flags API. Lookup by state now gives two statistics, Per Capita
income, and Industrial carbon emissions, as well as an image of the state flag
of the state being looked up. Changes reflected in README.

Updated instructions, added hyperlinks to APIs, updated design doc

Working implementation of BEA API, allowing the user to select a state to lookup
per-capita income from. Next steps are to incorporate a climate indicator, such
as tons of CO2, and generate a graph. Possible analysis tools: Correlation
Coefficient, comparison across states

Welcome page displays welcome message and US population, flashes successful sign
in if user just signed in.

DC was missing from states.csv, so I added it. Added dropdown in lookup.

Began making states API, programmed message flashing into templates for login
and register. states.csv needs to be incremented by 1!!!

Put some of the finishing touches on the login-registration

To make more awesome, we're going to write code as succinct and easy to read
as possible because that allows others to read code and evaluate
them quickly and easily. Updating the design doc frequently to reflect new ideas
and changes allows others to be aware of changes made and adjust accordingly.

To the design doc, added: specific bootstrap features to implement,
explanation of how we store our data and how to access it,
made users database more compact, added roles, added functions.

Finished preliminary design document.

Began working on implementing the UNSTATS API, running into an issue where
for most country codes, indicator 1.1.1 has blank "data." I don't know if this
is a problem with the API, my querystring, or something else. Indicator 1.1.1
for M49 code 1 (the World) works though, which is nice.
