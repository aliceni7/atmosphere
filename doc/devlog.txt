Working implementation of BEA API, allowing the user to select a state to lookup per-
capita income from. Next steps are to incorporate a climate indicator, such as tons of CO2,
and generate a graph. Possible analysis tools: Correlation Coefficient, comparison accross states

To make more awesome, we're going to write code as succint and easy to read
as possible because that allows others to read code and evaluate
them quickly and easily. Updating the design doc frequently to reflect new ideas
and changes allows others to be aware of changes made and adjust accordingly.

To the design doc, added: specific bootstrap features to implement,
explanation of how we store our data and how to access it,
made users database more compact, added roles, added functions.

Began working on implementing the UNSTATS API, running into an issue where
for most country codes, indicator 1.1.1 has blank "data." I don't know if this
is a problem with the API, my querystring, or something else. Indicator 1.1.1
for M49 code 1 (the World) works though, which is nice.
